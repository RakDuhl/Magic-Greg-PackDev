#
# *** READ THIS FIRST ***
#
# By default, this mod does not apply special borders to most items.  It was designed to work well with mod packs where
# the available selection of items can vary widely, so it is up to the user or mod pack designer to customize as needed.
# There are many options available for setting up which custom borders (also called frames) apply to which items.  Follow these steps:
#   1. Decide which items you want to have custom borders, and which borders.  Note that each custom border has a number associated with it (starting at 0).
#   2. For each custom border you want to use, fill out the associated list in the "definitions" section.  This will be filled out with a list of "selectors",
#      each of which tell the mod what items have that border.  Please read the information above the definitions section for specifics.
#   3. Selectors for borders are checked in the order provided in the "priorities" section.  Once a match is found, that border is displayed.
#      For example, if border 0 had the selector "%Diamond" and border 1 had the selector "diamond_sword", they would both match for diamond swords.
#      In this case, whichever border number came first in the priority list would be the border that would get drawn in-game.
#   4. Optionally, border colors associated with custom borders can be set in the "colors" section.  The start color is the color at the top of the tooltip,
#      and the end color is the bottom, with a smooth transition between.  Please read the information above the color section for specifics.

	# Entry types:
	#    Match all - Specifying just an asterisk (*) will match all items.  Examples: "*"
	#    Item ID - Use item ID to match single items.  Must include mod name for modded items.  Examples: "minecraft:stick", "iron_ore", "spoiledeggs:spoiled_egg"
	#    Tag - $ followed by tag name to match all items with that tag.  Examples: "$forge:stone", "$planks"
	#    Mod name - @ followed by mod identifier to match all items from that mod.  Examples: "@spoiledeggs"
	#    Rarity - ! followed by item's rarity to match all items with that rarity.  This is ONLY vanilla rarities.  Examples: "!uncommon", "!rare", "!epic"
	#    Item name color - # followed by color hex code, to match all items with that exact color item name.  Examples: "#23F632"
	#    Display name - % followed by any text.  Will match any item with this text (case-sensitive) in its tooltip display name.  Examples: "%Netherite", "%Uncommon"
	#    Tooltip text - ^ followed by any text.  Will match any item with this text (case-sensitive) anywhere in the tooltip text (besides the name).  Examples: "^Legendary"
	#    NBT tag - & followed by tag name and optional comparator (=, >, <, or !=) and value, in the format <tag><comparator><value> or just <tag>.  Examples: "&Damage=0", "&Tier>1", "&map!=128", "&Enchantments"
	#    Negation - ~ followed by any selector above.  This selector will be negated, matching every item that does NOT match the selector.  Examples: "~minecraft:stick", "~!uncommon", "~@minecraft"
	#    Combining selectors - Any number of selectors can be combined by separating them with a plus sign.  Examples: "minecraft:diamond_sword+&Enchantments", "minecraft:stick+~!common+&Damage=0"
